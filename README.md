### Supervised Learning
This implements several hyperparameter optimisation libraries on a variety of supervised learning problems, including classification and regression. Alogithims include Bayesian Optimisation (BO), and Tree-based Pipeline Optimisation (TPOT).

### Unsupervised Learning
This implements several hyperparameter optimisation libraries on a variety of reinforcement learning problems. Alogithims include Bayesian Optimisation (BO), Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO), Tree-structured Parzen Estimators (TPE), and grid-search.
